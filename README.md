**Battleship in Haskell**

**Developed by:** João Brito (m9984) and André Martins (m10157).

*More details at www.joaopedrobrito.com/projects/battleship.*

# Description
This project allows the user to **play a game of *Battleship* against the computer**. It was implemented in **Haskell** and runs on a CLI.

# Setup
**1.** Download and install **GHC/GHCI** from the official downloads page (https://www.haskell.org/downloads/);

**2.** Type "*ghci*" on a terminal window, followed by "*:l Main.hs*";

**3.** Type "*main*" to launch the game;

**4.** Follow the game's instructions and have fun!

# Code structure
* **Main.hs**: contains the function responsible for actually playing the game;
* **AuxFunctions.hs**: contains a plethora of pure and impure functions that are needed throughout the game;
* **GameMoves.hs**: contains the functions responsible for placing the player's and computer's ships, as well as, registering their attacking moves;
* **GamePrints.hs**: contains the functions that print the game's interface (messages, information screens, etc...);
* **Board.hs**: contains the type definitions and instance of ***Show*** for the type ***BoardF***;
* **Constants.hs**: contains the game's settings (board size, ship lengths, etc...)
* **GameState.hs**: contains some records for the state of the game, as well as, an instance of ***Show*** for the record ***GameState***.

# Implementation details
## The Board
The game makes use of a record where we have **offense and defense boards** for both the player and the computer. In the **defense boards**, each player has its ships and the markings corresponding to the attacking attempts from the opposing player. These markings are:

* **`** for a Ship;
* **x** for a Hit;
* **o** for a Miss; 
* **\*** for a Sunken Ship.

As for the **offense boards**, they comprise the guesses made by each player, obviously not knowing where the opposing ships are located.

For each board (represented by the ***Board*** data record), we have a function that maps each coordinate (***Coord***) to a position state (***PositionState***) and a list of lists with the coordinates of every ship that belongs to the board/player in question.

## The Players
Both players go through the process of distributing the ships in their respective boards. The computer does so automatically (either randomly or wisely - this behaviour can be configured with the boolean ***wiseComputer*** in ***Constants.hs***), while the player is asked to enter coordinates for every ship in the following format:

```md
startCoord;endCoord
e.g. (0,0);(0,4) - for a ship of size 5
```

Once the ships are in place, the game starts with each player attacking in turns.

As a side note, at any point, the player can press ***q*** to leave the game immediately.

## The Game
The player will be able to see both boards (**defense** and **offense**) like in a traditional ***Battleship*** game:

(Player) Attack position >
```

From this point forward, both players will enter coordinates in the familiar format (i.e. (line,column)) and wait for the program to state the outcomes, like so:

```md
o--------------------------------------------------------o
|                       ROUND INFO                       |
o--------------------------------------------------------o
| (Player) Coordinate (1,1) was a MISS!                  |
| (Computer) Coordinate (4,7) was a HIT!                 |
o--------------------------------------------------------o
```

Eventually, the game will come to an end with a message indicating the winner (or winners, in case of a tie). Then, the coordinates of every ship will be revealed:

```md
o--------------------------------------------------------o
|                       GAME OVER                        |
o--------------------------------------------------------o
| The player has won the game!				 |
o--------------------------------------------------------o
```

## Side Note
If needed, the code can be modified to put 2 computers against each other. To do so, one can **uncomment** every line within a ***BEGIN TEST VERSION*** ... ***END TEST VERSION*** block and, conversely, **comment** every line within a ***BEGIN FINAL VERSION*** ... ***END FINAL VERSION*** block.

These blocks can be found in:

* **Main.hs**;
* **GameMoves.hs**;
* **GameState.hs**.
